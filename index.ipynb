    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement a basic computational workflow with signac.\n",
    "The signac framework assists us in conducting a computational investigation by managing the data space for us.\n",
    "This means that we do not need to worry about how to organize our data on disk and how to keep track of meta data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections in this chapter demonstrate how to use signac for data space management and also show how to implement a very basic workflow.\n",
