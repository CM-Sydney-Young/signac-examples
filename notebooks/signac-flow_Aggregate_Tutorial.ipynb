    "# 3.3 signac-flow aggregation example\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a minimal example for running a signac-flow's **aggregation** feature which is not released yet.\n",
    "The example demonstrates how to compare an ideal gas with a lennard jones fluid by calculating a p-V phase diagram.\n",

    "## Before you start\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you installed signac. Since this work is under progress hence you'd need to clone the signac-flow repository from git into your system and install it in your virtual enviroment in editable mode.\n",
    "You can follow these steps to install signac-flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow.git\n",
    "pip install -e signac-flow\n",
    "cd signac-flow/\n",
    "git checkout feature/introduce-aggregator-classes\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can find the work done on the branch ``feature/introduce-aggregator-classes`` here: https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow/pull/336"
